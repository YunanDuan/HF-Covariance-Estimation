# HF-Covariance-Estimation
Ultra-High-Frequency Multivariate Covariance Estimation of Noisy and Asynchronous Asset Returns And its Application to Chinese Stock Market

Abstract: 
In order to find a positive-semidefinite estimtor of multivariate covari- ance matrices of noisy and aynchronous asset returns, we adopt and com- pare two methodologies: Kalman smoother and expectation maximization (KEM) algorithm and Gibbs sampler algorithm in Bayesian framework (Bayesian Method), where in both cases we model microstructure noise as measurement errors and asynchronous trading effects as missing obser- vations in an otherwise synchronous series. We then compare the perfor- mance of these two estimators along with another benchmark estimating approach using extensive simulation study. The empirical application to a high-frequency dataset of Chinese stock market confirms our simulation study.
